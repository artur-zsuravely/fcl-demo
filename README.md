# Flow Client Library demonstration
You can find an online demo [Here](http://34.71.72.144/) 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

### Setting up environment 
In order for this demo to work, you have to setup the dependencies first:

- [Install Flow CLI](https://github.com/onflow/flow/blob/master/docs/cli.md). The Flow CLI is a command-line interface that provides useful utilities for building Flow applications. The tool we need in this demo is **Flow emulator**, a local emulator of Flow blockchain.
- Install project dependencies with `yarn` or `yarn install`.

### Starting the services


## Switch to Devnet-9
